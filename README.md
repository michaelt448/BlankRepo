# Tips

Try experimenting with comparison operators ('<', '>', '===', etc.) int eh node REPL, which you can launch using the 'node command in Vagrant.'

Work on your code iteratively - that means in small pieces.

to help you figure how to use 'hungry' and 'avvailableTime' inside your function, try outputtingtheir values to the Terminal as follows.

``` javascript

  function whatToDoForLunch(hungry, availableTime) {
    console.log("hungry is", hungry);
    console.log("availableTime is", availableTime);
  }

  ````
